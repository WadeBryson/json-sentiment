"12 ContributorsFall In Love Lyrics[Verse 1]\nHeard you moved out to South Carolina\nJust like you always said we would\nPacked your bags in that old 4Runner\nThat I bought you when things were good\nI'm glad to see the stop sign didn't hit ya\nBring you back to your senses\nOh, it waved you gone, goodbye\nYeah, it waved you gone, goodbye\n\n[Verse 2]\nI heard you found yourself a brand new man\nPut a rock on your finger and he vowed you a second chance\nBuilt a house right by the coast\nThat ocean view is beautiful, but baby, I just want you to know\nHe don't know you like I did\nMoney talks, but I ain't buyin'\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause love's a smoke ring wrapped around your finger\nOne second, it's a blessin', and the next, it's already gone\nA broken heart, I'm a walkin' testimony\nMy confession is a lesson that I'm pourin' out in this song\nOh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah\nYou don't wanna fall in love\nOh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah\nYou don't wanna fall in love\nSee Bailey Zimmerman LiveGet tickets as low as $24You might also like[Bridge]\nI seen your mama walkin' out the county market\nAnd I thought to ask her how she's been\nSaid she's missin' ya and tried to go convincin' ya\nNot to settle down with him\nShe ain't wrong, the whole town knows it\nYou had a bed of roses, but girl, you couldn't walk that line\nYou can act like you're doin' fine\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause love's a smoke ring wrapped around your finger\nOne second, it's a blessin', and the next, it's already gone\nA broken heart, I'm a walkin' testimony\nMy confession is a lesson that I'm pourin' out in this song\nOh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah\nYou don't wanna fall in love\nOh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah\nYou don't wanna fall in love\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause love's a smoke ring wrapped around your finger\nOne second, it's a blessin', and the next, it's already gone\nA broken heart, I'm a walkin' testimony\nMy confession is a lesson that I'm pourin' out in this song\nOh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah\nYou don't wanna fall in love\nOh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah\nYou don't wanna fall in love\nOh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah\nYou don't wanna fall in love\nOh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah\n[Outro]\nHeard you moved out to South Carolina\nJust like you always said we wouldEmbed"
